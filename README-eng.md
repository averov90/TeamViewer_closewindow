### Automatically closing the "Sponsored session" window in TeamViewer
###### You will need to compile the program for your language, because by default the program looks for the TeamViewer window with the Russian title.
This program is intended for compilation using MSVC Compiler.

The program allows you to automate the closing of the "Sponsored session" window, which appears after the end of the remote support session in TeamViewer. This app works as a background - you can set it to start automatically and you will no longer have to watch The TeamViewer window about the sponsored session - it will close correctly by emulating a click on the " OK " button. 

This currently works with all (even the newest) versions of TeamViewer.
